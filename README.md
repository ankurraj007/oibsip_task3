This repository contains a To-Do List application developed as part of my internship at Oasis Infobyte. The application allows users to create, manage, and track tasks efficiently. It's built with a clean interface, providing an easy way to organize tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove completed or unnecessary tasks.
- **Mark Tasks as Complete**: Mark tasks as done with a single click.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is optimized for both desktop and mobile views.
- **Persistent Data**: Stores tasks locally, so your tasks remain saved even after closing the browser.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For application logic and interactivity.
- **LocalStorage**: To store the tasks persistently in the browser.
